# Understanding concurrency: a comparison C, JS, Java, Ruby, Golang

Gaurav Agarwal

---

# Agenda

* Concurrency vs Parallelism
* The UNIX way

  * Brief overview of concurrency in C

* Concurrency without threads or processes?

  * JS -> Promises

* What makes concurrency hard?

* Java vs interpreted languages like Python and Ruby

* An elegant solution to the messy problems of concurrency: Go

# What is concurrency?

---
class: center, middle

Concurrency is the composition of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.

# What's the problem with Threads and Processes?

---

## Processes

* Each process has dedicated memory
* Risk of zombies
* Context switching overhead
* Requires inter-process communication

---

## Threads

* Shared memory
* Race conditions & deadlocks
* Context switching overhead
* Lower memory footprint than process, but still high (~8 MB)

# Go

* Comes from the CSP paper, same as Erlang
* Has lightweight user-space threads, (~8 KB)
* Go's scheduler does the heavy-lifting
